# Woodwalkers Spell Books

A simple mod that integrates [Woodwalkers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/woodwalkers) with
[Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irons-spells-n-spellbooks).

With this mod, you'll need to use a new evocation spell called *Shapeshifting* to transform
into other creatures. The spell also requires and consumes experience from the player.

> Currently supported minecraft version and modloader is 1.20.1 and Forge.
